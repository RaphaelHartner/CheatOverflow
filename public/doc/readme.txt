Read me for the incredible CheatOverflow-App

CheatOverflow is a web-app, which gives you the opportunity to easily cheat on every IT-related test ;-)
First of all, on the homepage there are three(depends on the device) columns where you can find the most
recent questions on stakeoverflow about JSON, JavaScript and HTML5.

You are also able to search for a specific term in the search box. If there are no locations saved, Stackoverflow is
used as forum. On the other hand if you have specified a location, the nearest to your current position
will be choosed and in the specified forum will be searched for the term.


on the "About Us"-page you can find a couple information about the app
on the "About Stackoverflow"-page you can find a couple information and a link to the official stackoverflow-about-site

on the "Map"-Page you can see a map with your current position(if location sharing is allowed) and the locations which
you have defined.
For specifying a new location, you need following information:
    Location name: for example "FH Joanneum Kapfenberg"
    Field name: for example "IT" or "Web-Technologies"
    StackExchange site: for example "Stack Overflow"
locations will be stored locally.
For deleting a location, select it by clicking on it and press the "Delete"-Button
